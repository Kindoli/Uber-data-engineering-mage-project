# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project
## Introduction
In this Uber Data Analytics project, I am leveraging modern data engineering tools like mage.ai, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Cloud Storage on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The project involves designing a comprehensive data pipeline and analytics dashboard to extract, transform, and visualize key insights from Uber's extensive datasets.
